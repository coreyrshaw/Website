Research topics/studies:

- Syndromic surveillance: we are utilizing real-time social media data, natural language processing and machine learning methods to identify and track symptom distributions over time. 

- Localized outbreak detection: we are combining retrospective data from social media with data from GDPH to train AI algorithms that can detect patterns in social media chatter indicative of localized outbreaks.

- Toxicosurveillance: we are building methods that can detect unapproved treatments that are promoted for treating COVID to identify potential toxic exposures. 

- MOUD treatment access during COVID: in line with our past work, we are studying how COVID is affecting SUD and OUD treatment programs.

- COVID and mental health: we are studying the impact of COVID on mental health using social media mining methods. 

- Impact of COVID on national services such as Medicaid.
